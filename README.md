# Simple Youtube Downloader

Instead of relying on shady websites filled with intrusive ads, pop-ups, and the risk of accidentally downloading unwanted software or media, I built a simple and secure YouTube downloader using pytubefix. To make it even more accessible and user-friendly, I wrapped it in a lightweight Streamlit app, allowing anyone to download YouTube videos quickly and safely with just a few clicks â€” no ads, no hidden downloads, and no hassle.
